  My most recent choice was to leave a discipleship and pursue a career. Writing
  that is seems like a mistake and an easy choice. But looking at it from the
  perspective of the man I am today, having a job that will get me the
  experience I need, in process of getting an apartment with a friend, going to
  an accredited college for the first time at 24.
